## 我是云顶六期全栈（Full_Stack）方向

Is it reasonable to expect mere morals to have mastery over every  facet of the development stack? Probably not, but Facebook can ask for  it. I was told at OSCON by a Facebook employee that they only hire ‘Full Stack’ developers.  Well, what does that mean?

To me, a Full Stack Developer is someone with familiarity in each  layer, if not mastery in many and a genuine interest in all software  technology.

**Good developers who are familiar with the entire stack know how to make life easier for those around them.** This is why I’m so against silos in the work place. Sure, politics and  communication challenges get in the way in large organizations. I think  the point Facebook is going for with their hiring policy is, if smart  people use their heads and their hearts, a better product gets built in  less time.

### layers of the full stack:

#### 1.Server, Network, and Hosting Environment.

1.This involves understanding what can break and why, taking no resource for granted.
 2.Appropriate use of the file system, cloud storage, network resources,  and an understanding of data redundancy and availability is necessary.
 3.How does the application scale given the hardware constraints?What about multi-threading and race conditions?
 4.Guess what, you won’t see those on your development machine, but they can and do happen in the real world.
 5.Full stack developers can work side by side with DevOps. The system  should provide useful error messages and logging capabilities. DevOps  will see the messages before you will, so make them count.

#### 2.Data Modeling

1.If the data model is flawed, the business logic and higher layers  start to need strange (ugly) code to compensate for corner cases the  data model doesn’t cover.
 2.Full stack developers know how to create a reasonably normalized  relational model, complete with foreign keys, indexes, views, lookup  tables, etc.
 3.Full stack developers are familiar with the concept of non-relational  data stores and understand where they shine over relational data stores.

#### 3.Business Logic

1.The heart of the value the application provides.
 2.Solid object oriented skills are needed here.
 3.Frameworks might be needed here as well.

#### 4.API layer / Action Layer / MVC

1.How the outside world operates against the business logic and data model.
 2.Frameworks at this level should be used heavily.
 3.Full stack developers have the ability to write clear, consistent,  simple to use interfaces. The heights to which some APIs are convoluted  repel me.

#### 5.User Interface

1.Full stack developers: a) understand how to create a readable  layout, or b) acknowledge they need help from artists and graphic  designers. Either way, implementing a good visual design is key.
 2.Can include mastery of HTML5 / CSS.
 3.JavaScript is the up and coming language of the future and lots of  exciting work is being done in the JavaScript world (node, backbone,  knockout…)

#### 6.User Experience

1.Full stack developers appreciate that users just want things to work.
 2.A good system doesn’t give its users carpal tunnel syndrome or sore  eyes. A full stack developer can step back and look at a process that  needs 8 clicks and 3 steps, and get it down to one click.Full stack  developers write useful error messages. If something breaks, be  apologetic about it. Sometimes programmers inadvertently write error  messages that can make people feel stupid.Understanding what the  customer and the business need.Now we are blurring into the line of  architect, but that is too much of a hands off role.
 3.Full stack developers write useful error messages. If something  breaks, be apologetic about it. Sometimes programmers inadvertently  write error messages that can make people feel stupid.

#### 7.Understanding what the customer and the business need.

1.Now we are blurring into the line of architect, but that is too much of a hands off role.
 2.Full stack developers have a grasp of what is going on in the field  when the customer uses the software. They also have a grasp of the  business.

------

### Other Pieces of the Puzzle:

1.Ability to write quality unit tests. By the way, even JavaScript can have unit tests these days.
 2.Understanding of repeatable automated processes for building the  application, testing it, documenting it, and deploying it at scale.
 3.An awareness of security concerns is important, as each layer presents its own possible vulnerabilities.

------

### Closing Thoughts:

It is very bad practice to tightly couple code to a specific  implementation (library, OS, hardware, etc). Just because a full stack  developer understands the entire spectrum doesn’t mean they have license to take shortcuts. Well, actually they do if it is a build and throw  away prototype.
 Technology start-ups need full stack developers for their versatility!   However, as an organization matures, it needs more and more focused  skills.
 I’m not sure you can call yourself a full stack developer until you have worked in multiple languages, platforms, and even industries in your  professional career. **Full stack goes beyond a ‘senior engineer’, as it is along the same lines as a polyglot programmer but with a  higher view of all the connecting pieces.**
